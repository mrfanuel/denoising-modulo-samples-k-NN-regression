# denoising-modulo-samples-k-NN-regression

This repository contains scripts associated to the paper entitled 
>Denoising modulo samples:k-NN regression and tightness of SDP relaxation
by Fanuel and Tyagi.

A few implementations of densoising/unwrapping methods were shared with us by M. Cucuringu; see the following paper
>M. Cucuringu and H. Tyagi. Provably robust estimation of modulo 1 samples of a smooth func-tion with applications to phase unwrapping.Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(32):1â€“77, 2020.
