This repository contains scripts associated to the paper 
>M. Fanuel and H. Tyagi, Denoising modulo samples:k-NN regression and tightness of SDP relaxation, to appear in Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04850.pdf

A few implementations of denoising/unwrapping methods were shared with us by M. Cucuringu; see the following paper
>M. Cucuringu and H. Tyagi. Provably robust estimation of modulo 1 samples of a smooth func-tion with applications to phase unwrapping. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(32):1â€“77, 2020.
